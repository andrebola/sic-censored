[{"artist": "Asayel Slay", "lyrics": ["He is drowning all my sorrow beneath a flood of peace\nHe is shaping cries of mourning to sweeping melodies\nHe is shouldering my burdens and yoking me with strength\nHe is laughing at my troubles, they're all breaking at His feet\n\nHe is right here\nTo handle a world full of care\nTo answer the cause of my prayers\nHe is right here\nHe is right here\nTo catch me as I'm letting go\nTo grab me as I lose control\nHe is right here\n\nHe is healing all my wandering, He's bound my wayward heart\nHe is forming past regrets to honest works of art\nHe is working in the waiting for His glory and my good\nHe is bringing down my mountains in ways only He could\n\nHe is right here\nTo handle a world full of care\nTo answer the cause of my prayers\nHe is right here\nHe is right here\nTo catch me as I'm letting go\nTo grab me as I lose control\nHe is right here", "I feel You so close to me\nThat I can hardly move or breathe\nI can feel Your presence all around\nI fall knees down to the ground\n\nYou're the One that really matters\nYou're the One that really matters\nYou're the One that really matters\nYou're the One that really matters\n\nI know that I have been found\nThe cares of life can't hold me down\n'Cause You're the One I wanna please\nWhat matters now is what You think\n\nYou're the One that really matters\nYou're the One that really matters\nYou're the One that really matters\nYou're the One that really matters\n\nAnd I know that I have been found\nThe cares of life can't hold me down\n'Cause You're the One I wanna please\nWhat matters now is what You think"]}, {"artist": "Abdallah Al Shahani", "lyrics": []}, {"artist": "Jeddah Amasy", "lyrics": []}]
