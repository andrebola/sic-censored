light\r\nSomething worth my aspiration and a fight\r\nAnd there was a time when all this only seemed\r\nLike some sky-aspiring vision I had dreamed\r\n\r\nFaded grey are all the days of yesteryears\r\nSo much time has turned to memories and to tears\r\nLately I have often sat and thought till dawn\r\nOf the days that are to come and those forgone\r\n\r\nSeemed my time had passed me by\r\nLike clouds across the sky\r\nI was lost just like a raven in the night\r\nMost dreams waste away alas\r\nMine all have come to pass\r\nSince I laid my eyes upon my guiding light\r\n\r\nValkyrja\r\nValkyrja\r\n\r\nLate is now the hour of the day\r\nAnd I've long ago run out of words to say\r\nDeep within I had the will to find a way\r\nOthers fled to fight again some other day\r\n\r\nI've heard said that all is fair in love and war\r\nThat a golden key can open any door\r\nAnd remember if you feel all hope is gone\r\nThat the darkest hour comes just before the dawn\r\n\r\nSeemed my time had passed me by\r\nLike clouds across the sky\r\nI was lost just like a raven in the night\r\nMost dreams waste away alas\r\nMine all have come to pass\r\nSince I laid my
