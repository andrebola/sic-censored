believe the things that they say.", "Work hard towards nothing,\na garden growing hurts.\nFresh wheels but no body,\na truck that just won't work.\nDead leaves burn as easily as gasoline does,\ngasoline does.\nAnd now your soul is bruised,\nand now your soul is bruised,\nand now your soul is bruised,\nand your color is violet.\nWork hard for nothing,\na garden growing rusts.\nDead flower 4 barrel,\nfertilizing the dirt.\nDead leaves burn as easily as gasoline does,\ngasoline does.\nAnd now your soul is bruised,\nand now your soul is bruised,\nand now your soul is bruised,\nand your color is violence.\nWhy can't I decide\nbetween two things I've found\nin my own lifetime\nleft here all the time.\nAnd now your soul is bruised,\nand now your soul is bruised,\nand now your soul is bruised,\nand your color is violence.\nAnd now your soul is bruised,\nand now your soul is bruised, my friend,\nand now your soul is bruised,\nand your color is violence.\nAnd now your soul is

the way you love me\nForget about the world, we're set in stone\nI'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now\nIf only I could hit the ground\nI never thought that I'd be broken\nI never thought I'd be

could hit the ground\nI could hit the ground, right now\nIf only I could hit the ground\nIf I could hit the ground\nThen I'd be falling down\nIf only I could hit the ground\nIf I could hit the
