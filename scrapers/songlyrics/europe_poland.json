beneath your wisdom like a stone\r\n\r\nAnd you want to travel with him\r\nAnd you want to travel blind\r\nAnd you think maybe you'll trust him\r\nFor he's touched your perfect body with his mind\r\n\r\nNow Suzanne takes your hand\r\nAnd she leads you to the river\r\nShe is wearing rags and feathers\r\nFrom Salvation Army counters\r\nAnd the sun pours down like honey\r\nOn our lady of the harbor\r\nAnd she shows you where to look\r\nAmong the garbage and the flowers\r\n\r\nThere are heroes in the seaweed\r\nThere are children in the morning\r\nThey are leaning out for love\r\nAnd they will lean that way forever while Suzanne holds the mirror\r\n\r\nAnd you want to travel with her\r\nAnd you want to travel blind\r\nAnd you know that you can trust her\r\nFor she's touched your perfect body with her mind", "You came to me this morning and you handled me like meat. You\u2019d have to be a man to know how good that feels, how sweet. My mirrored twin, my next of kin, I\u2019d know you in my sleep and who but you would take me in,\na thousand kisses deep.\n\nI loved you when you opened like a lily to the heat, see I\u2019m just another snowman standing in the rain and sleet, who loved you with his frozen love and his second hand physique, with he is and all he was,\nA thousand kisses deep.\n\nI know you had to lie to me, I know you had to cheat, to pose all hot and high behind the veils of shear deceit, a perfect born aristocrat so elegant and cheap, I\u2019m old but I\u2019m still into that,\nA thousand kisses deep\n\nI\u2019m good at love, I\u2019m good at hate, its in between I freeze. Been working out, but its too late, it\u2019s been to late for years. But you look good, you really do, they love you on the street. If I could move I\u2019d kneel for you,\na thousand kisses deep.\n\nThe autumn moved across your skin, got something in my eye, a light that doesn\u2019t need to live, and doesn\u2019t need to die. A riddle in the book of love, obscure and obsolete, to witness tear and time and blood,\nA thousand kisses deep.\n\nI\u2019m still working with the wine, still dancing cheek to cheek, the band is playing Auld Laing Sine, but the heart will not retreat. I ran with Dez and I sang with Ray, I never had their sweep, but once or twice they let me play\nA thousand kisses deep.\n\nI loved you when you opened like a lily to heat, just another snowman standing in the sleet, who loved you with his frozen love, his second hand physique, with all he is, and all he was,\nA thousand kisses deep\n\nBut you don\u2019t need to hear me now, and every word I speak, it counts against me anyhow,\nA thousand kisses deep."]}]
