so full, I can't explain\nSeeking faith and speaking words, I never thought I'd say\n\nThere can be miracles when you believe\nThough hope is frail, it's hard to kill\nWho knows what miracles you can achieve\nWhen you believe, somehow you will\nYou will when you believe\n\nThey don't always happen when you ask\nAnd it's easy to give in to your fear, oh\nBut when you're blinded by your pain\nCan't
