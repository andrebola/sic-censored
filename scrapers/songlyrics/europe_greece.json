[{"artist": "Scott Walker", "lyrics": ["I've watched her from the river banks\nI knew her when she danced with dreams\nWhite doves were there to dress her hair\nAnd so was Madelaine\n\nAt night the people's faces danced\nLike pearls colliding on the breast\nOf fat Marie whose thunder laugh\nWas just a thread from crying\n\nHer sailors stained her cobblestones\nWith wine and piss and death desire\nAnd sometimes blood for Madelaine\nWhose laughter was the night\n\nHer girls would lift their dresses high\nand breathe the stars and kiss the sky\nShe'd smother them with whispers then\nEmbrace them with her sighs\n\nBefore the bottle dulled my eyes\nAnd made me so I couldn't stand\nI'd overact and play the clown\nWhen Madelaine would cry\n\nAnd now I watch from riverbanks\nI watch it weave it's memories\nWhite doves turned gray and flew away\nAnd so did Madelaine", "Mist falls and his voice cracks from the morning\nFlowers and my body feels like lead\nSomeone should have stopped the birds from singing today\nHammers from striking nails into clay\n\nHer face penetrates the blue gray morning\nHer eyes pregnant pools produce a tear\nSomeone should have shouted you had gone in her ear\nThat summer was stolen away\n\nSuch a small love\nSuch a little tear\nYou would laugh so loud\nIf you could see us here\n\nWith my one suit\nBadly pressed and worn\nLike a child left\nIn the world alone\n\nHe speaks I don't hear a word he's saying\nHang on to the pine trees and the snow\nReach out grab the memories that are left for your hand\nThey'll help you get by for a while\n\nSuch a small love\nSuch a little tear\nIs this all that's left\nOn your cheek so pale\n\nHis shallow half lit eyes\nHis rotted teeth grown on\nA drunken madman nights\nEnding up in hjail\n\nWith night fallings\nDrenched in day-glo red\nWords collided\nThings we left unsaid\n\nPerfumed pillows\nGirls that clung so near\nSuch a small love\nSuch a little tear", "It's raining today\nand I'm just about to forget the train window girl\nThat wonderful day we met\nShe smiles through the smoke from my cigarette\nIt's raining today\nBut once there was summer and you\nAnd dark little rooms\nAnd sleep in late afternoons\nThose moments descend on my windowpane\nI've hung around here too long\nListenin' to the old landlady's hard-luck stories\nYou out of me me out of you\nWe go like lovers\nTo replace the empty space\nRepeat our dreams to someone new\nIt's raining today\nAnd I watch the cellophane streets\nNo hang-ups for me\n'Cause hang-ups need company\nThe street corner girl's a cold trembling leaf\nIt's raining today\nIt's raining today", "We came through\nWe came riding through like warriors from afar\nOur black horses danced upon the graves of yesterday's desires\nHaunted by our visions framed in fire\nI greet you, for you still believe in what's behind a door\nYou've seen the children freeze upon their knees\nAnd praying to the wind\nDescend their grey madonnas back again\nFire the guns, and salute the men who died for freedom's sake\nAnd we'll weep tonight, but we won't lie awake\nGazing up at statues dressed in stars\nWe won't dream, for they don't come true for us\nNot anymore\nThey've run afar to hide in caves\nWith haggard burning eyes\nTheir icy voices tear our hearts like knives\n\nWe came through\nLike the Gothic monsters perched on Notre Dame\nWe observe the naked souls of gutters pouring forth mankind\nSmothered in an avalanche of time\nAnd we're giants as we watch our kings and countries raise their\nshields\nAnd Guevara dies encased in their ideals\nAnd as Luther King's predictions fade from view\nWe came through", "(Engel)\r\n\r\nI spent many a night laying on my back\r\nWaiting for the dawn to pierce a crack in the ceiling\r\nHanging from the sky\r\nAnd I envied the boy who grabbed the toy\r\nAnd ran away and found the joy\r\nWhile I stood in the shadows wondering why\r\nFlying towards me, wrapped in laughter\r\nA woman's face, a terrible taste\r\nOf the morning after kisses and goodbyes\r\nI can never seem to catch my footsteps\r\nHave desires they fly away\r\nAnd every day I've got to fight the Plague\r\n\r\nHow can I live an hour like this\r\nWhen anguish strikes me like a fist\r\nMy nakedness exposed, and I can't stand\r\nStill I try to remember lips on lips\r\nAnd hits on the hips, and ice and fire\r\nand gloom and glow\r\nWhen did they leave the man\r\nIn the river of the night I see\r\nA face that shimmers down at me\r\nBut like a falling star burns itself out\r\nLike a lead leaf scrapes the gravelled ground\r\nMy voice cries out, a gravelled sound\r\nBut no-one's there to hear me but the Plague\r\n\r\nStraining hard to see\r\nRunning after me\r\nI keep pounding\r\nPounding on the door\r\nBut it's all so vague\r\nWhen you meet the Plague\r\nAnd I keep coming, I keep coming back for more", "We do not have the lyrics for Amsterdam yet.", "We do not have the lyrics for
