petition the Government for a redress of grievances\n\nSo what I'd like to do\nIs ask our President a few questions\nWith respect\n\nTalk to them now\n\nDear Mr. President, with all due respect\nWish we could have a conversation\nI would take a trip down to your residence\nAnd we would talk about the state of the nation\n\nMr. President, I would ask you about the war\nReally and truly, what is it for?\nWhen a I.E.D. make a soldier fall\nIs he dying for something above us all?\n\nIs it all about him at the end of the day\nIs a pledge of allegiance just something to say\nI hope not 'cause I love the USA\nDespite of all the drama we have today\n\nMr. President are you aware?\nOur flesh and blood is dying over there\nWhen the coffins come back, do you care?\nWhen only the poor kids die, is it fair?\n\nIf I could talk to the President\nWould he pay attention, really listen?\nIf I say something intelligent\nWould he be willing to change his position?\n\nNow it's time, time, time\nFor me to speak my mind, mind, mind\n\nDon't get me wrong, I respect the flag\nBut it hurt to see a kid in a body bag\nHe fought for his country with all he had\nNow he have a family without a dad\n\nWith a mama crying and the kids are scared\n9/11, why were we unprepared?\nMr. President, are you aware?\nUnless you rich, you have poor health care\n\nMakes you scream and wanna pull out your hair\nDischarged from hospitals soon as you get there\nMr. President, truth or dare?\nTerrorists are hiding, and you know where\n\nIllegal immigrants are everywhere\nIs it really their fault, they wanted to come here\nI respect you, please be clear\nBut talk with me, show the people you care\n\nIf I could talk to the President\nWould he pay attention, really listen?\nIf I say something intelligent\nWould he be willing to change his position?\n\nNow it's time, time, time\nFor me to speak my mind, mind, mind\n\nThe children didn't say\n\nWhat am I to do, I've been waiting near you\nTell me something that I just make sense\nYou sent us off to war, please be honest what it's for\nDoes it matter if it's life or death? Yeah\n\nI'm not Republican or Democrat\nI'm independent and I want the facts\nWhen are the soldiers coming back?\nAre we prepared for a terror attack?\n\nLate at night I watch CNN\nIt gets so bad, I might stop breathing\nThe Middle East hates us, what's the reason?\nMr. President, my heart is bleeding\n\nI tuck my kids in every evening\nTry to teach them to keep believing\nHoping my government won't deceive them\nTell 'em, touch your goals, you could achieve them\n\nMr. President, I have to know\nIf I die for you, what will I have to show?\nWill it really and truly help our country grow?\nI'm waiting for your answer, let me know\n\nIf I could talk to the President\nWould he pay attention, really listen?\nIf I say something intelligent\nWould he be willing to change his position?\n\nNow it's time, time, time\nFor me to speak my mind, mind, mind\n\nNow it's time, time, time\nFor me to speak my mind, mind, mind\n\nNow it's time, time, time\nFor me to speak my mind, mind, mind\n\nNow it's time", "LL Cool J\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nMr. Goodbar\r\n(LL Cool J)\r\nNah y'all nah y'all uh-uh\r\nI ain't disrespectin though\r\nI'm just sayin it happen to me\r\nIt can happen to him\r\nHow you doin?\r\nWhat's your name?\r\nUh, mmm, haha\r\nOh you're his girl\r\n\r\n(LL Cool J)\r\nHello my name is Mr. Goodbar\r\nI'm came to offer champagne \r\nLater on maybe I'll tell you my real name\r\nBut for now sip your drink and be merry\r\nAnd be a nice girl and sing me a cherry\r\nMe, I'll have a Cowa-loo and milk\r\nCause champagne always stains my silk\r\nYou got a man?
