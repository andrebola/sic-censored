you have.\n\nAnd all this years spent sitting here\nWaiting to be free.\n\nMy day has come\nAnd I can finally see.\n\nGloria-ah-ah-ah-ah\nGloria-ah-ah-ah-ah\nGloria-ah-ah-ah-ah.\n\nI've dreamed of waking up beyond that wall\nIt looks like I might make it after all.\n\nThere's a kid in here\nReminds me of my son\nI watch him with the others\nWhen they laugh about what they've done.\n\nSo many ways\nTo impress one so young\nThe day they let him out of here\nHe's gonna find himself a gun.\n\nI tried to say\nTried to make him understand\nFear is not respect\nAnd it won't make a boy a man\nOh, you make mistakes\nAnd you make them all again\nIt seems that I offended\nOne of those godforsaken men.\n\nIn all these years spent sitting here\nThe last thing that I see\nIs a baby face\nWith a blade that's made for me.\n\nGloria-ah-ah-ah-ah\nGloria-ah-ah-ah-ah\nGloria-ah-ah-ah-ah.\n\nI guess some things were never meant to be.\n\nGloria-ah-ah-ah-ah\nGloria-ah-ah-ah-ah\nGloria-ah-ah-ah-ah.\n\nSo open up that gate and welcome me\nMy spirits flown\nAnd I'm finally free\nFinally free... yeah!"]}, {"artist": "Tamer Nafar",
