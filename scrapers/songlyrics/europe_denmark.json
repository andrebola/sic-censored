[{"artist": "Weiwei", "lyrics": ["I had a dream so big and loud\nI jumped so high I touched the clouds\nI stretched my hands out to the sky\nWe danced with monsters through the night\nI'm never gonna look back\nWoah!\nI'm never gonna give it up\nNo!\nPlease don't wake me now\nThis is gonna be the best day of my life\nMy li-i-i-i-i-i-ife\nThis is gonna be the best day of my life\nMy li-i-i-i-i-i-ife\nI howled at the moon with friends\nAnd then the sun came crashing in\nBut all the possibilities\nNo limits just epiffanies\nI hear it calling\nOutside my window\nI feel it in my soul\nThis is gonna be the best day of my life\nMy li-i-i-i-i-i-ife\nThis is gonna be the best day of my life\nMy li-i-i-i-i-i-ife\nThis is gonna be the best day of my life\nMy li-i-i-i-i-i-ife\nThis is gonna be the best day of my life\nMy li-i-i-i-i-i-ife\nThis is gonna be the best day of my life\nMy li-i-i-i-i-i-ife\nThis is gonna be the best day of my life\nMy li-i-i-i-i-i-ife\nThis is gonna be the best day of my life\nMy li-i-i-i-i-i-ife\nThis is gonna be the best day of my life\nMy li-i-i-i-i-i-ife"]}]
