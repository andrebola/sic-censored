  <p> Our main goals with that project are:<p>
  
  <p> _Letting the artists know which words in what context and which lyrics are/were censored in every country.<p>

  <p> _Letting the artists know which in what context and which lyrics could be censored through the censorship predictive model.<p>

  <p> _Visualize censorship through data in every country.<p>
